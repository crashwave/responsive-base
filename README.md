responsive-base
===============

Responsive Base is a child theme built on the mobile first approach to responsive web design. It was created not to just be responsive, but to act as a template or starting point for child theme development for the Thematic Theme Framework.

It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic 1.0+, but works on 9.7.7 and above.
