Responsive Base, for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

Responsive Base is a child theme built on the mobile-first approach to responsive web design. It was created not to just be responsive, but to act as a template or starting point for child theming with the Thematic Theme Framework and WordPress.

It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic 1.0+, but works on 9.7.7 and above.
